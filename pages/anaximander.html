	<h3>LIFE OF ANAXIMANDER</h3>
	<p>Anaximander (Ἀναξίμανδρος), son of Praxiades, was born in 610 BCE at the city Miletus in Ionia. Anaximander is supposedly the first person to author a philosophical treatise in Greek prose. His most important work is called “On Nature”. We know from the Suda, a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, that there were several other books which were thought to have been written by him, but it’s more likely that these books are simply parts of "On Nature", rather than entirely separate, individual works. They are, as follows: (a) Map of the Earth; (b) On the Fixed Stars; (c) The Sphere. 

	Anaximander, as the titles of the works given above seem to suggest, was a geographer. Indeed, he, along with Hecataeus of Miletus, was among the earliest of the Greeks who was said to have conducted research in geography. He allegedly drew a map of the world and built a sphere which resembled the Earth. 

	He, like Thales, was also a politically active citizen of Miletus. He supposedly established a colony at the city of Apollonia in the Black Sea region.

	He once warned the Spartans of an imminent earthquake and told them to sleep fully armed in the fields outside their city. The earthquake eventually came and, according to Cicero, it was so strong that it tore off the peak of Mt Taygetus.

	As regards his personality, he seems to have been a very ambitious person. Diodorus of Ephesus allegedly said that Empedocles imitated Anaximander by putting on ostentatious displays and wearing showy attire. There was an incident where children made fun of Anaximander's singing, and upon hearing their jibes, he promised to himself that he should do better for the sake of the children.

	Anaximander died at the age of 64 in 547 BCE. There is a tendentious claim found in Diogenes Laertius regarding when he lived. This date which was supposedly calculated by Apollodorus of Athens appears to be wrong because it states Anaximander flourished during the reign of Polycrates. But this can't be true, because Polycrates began to rule in 538 BCE, well after the established date of Anaximander's death.</p>

	<h3>REVIEW</h3>
	<p>The chief characteristic of Anaximander’s philosophy is the emphasis on a concept he calls "the unlimited", or "το ἀπείρων" in the original Greek which roughly means “without any boundary or limit". The Greek term is a combination of two words: the affix "ἀ" which typically designates privation or absence, and the Ionic form of πεῖραρ -- πέρας -- which stands for "extremity" or "border". The earliest instance of this word can be found in Homer, and here's an example of its use in the Iliad: 
	"But of thee I reck not in thine anger, no, not though thou shouldst go to the nethermost bounds of earth and sea, where abide Iapetus and Cronos," 
	Homer: Ilias, VIII.478
	There is some limitation (no pun intended) with regard to the meaning this word possesses in its English form. The term not only suggests the notion of boundlessness in space, as its English equivalent seems to imply, but it also affirms infinitude in time as well; because πέρας can also mean "end", "conclusion", or "termination". Anaximander, therefore, says το ἀπείρων is unaging. It is without any beginning or end and it surrounds all worlds. Moreover, it steers all things, and because he asserts this, Anaximander can be called a believer in providence. It is through this principle (άρχή) that all things are born and destroyed. This process of generation and corruption is described by Anaximander to be like that of fate or destiny (χρεών) where the elements pay the penalty (δίκη) and recompense (τίσις) to each other for their injustice (άδίκη) according to the arrangement (τάξις) of time (χρόνος). This passage is a bit difficult to understand, as it's the only verbatim fragment we have from his written works, so I will try to elucidate it a little by pointing out the significance of the Greek terms employed here. Now, the first part of the declaration, which states that the process of creation and destruction is akin to "fate" or "destiny" means that this phenomenon is similar to a situation in which one is obliged to do something, and thus the word "χρεών" can also be translated as "necessity". Next, the words "δίκη" and "άδίκη" are obviously related to the name of the Greek goddess of justice: Dike. The word "χρόνος" denotes the passing of time. The last two words, namely "τίσις" and "τάξις", possess a particularly interesting meaning which is not clearly understood in the English translation. The former means "payment", "recompense", "punishment" or "expiation" -- in short, the fulfillment of justice. The latter is often used to describe military arrangements and it's from this word that we get words like "syntax". 

	The other parts of Anaximander's "On Nature" were seemingly concerned with cosmology, meteorology and zoology. In them he claimed that there is an eternal motion in the universe. Whether this pronouncement refers to Thales' "great divine spirit" which moves through the world is open to interpretation.

	Contrary to Thales, he believed that the Earth rests upon nothing and remains suspended because it is equally distant to everything in the universe. The shape of the Earth, according to Anaximander, is curved, round and reminiscent of the smoothness of a stone column. The stars are like wheels of fire surrounded by air. The stars are, moreover, separated from the cosmic fire that pervades the entire universe. There are aulos-shaped orifices through which the light of the stars appears, and when these passages are obstructed in some way, eclipses happen. The waxing and waning of the moon is likewise explained by this hypothesis.

	There is a certain passage concerning the sizes of the sun, moon and the stars that seems to be missing a few phrases. Hermann Diels thought this segment, which is found in St. Hippolytus' Refutations, was especially lacunose and decided to emendate the text. As it stands, the passage states that Anaximander believed the circle of the sun to be 27 times larger than the moon and that the sun occupies the highest position in the heavens with the moon being next and the fixed stars coming last. Diels corrects this to say that the sun is 27 times larger than the Earth, that the sun is 19 times larger than the moon and that the planets occupy the lowest position in the heavens after the sun, the moon, and the fixed stars, respectively.

	Another, seemingly bizarre set of doctrines espoused by Anaximander concerns the notion of world. Anaximander supposed that there are innumerable worlds out there, some of which are eternally being born and others perpetually perishing. All of these worlds are said to come out of the unlimited substance. They are equally distant from each other. They are also destructible, as they are destroyed when they return to the unlimited substance from which they have originated. Anaximander connects this doctrine of the worlds with theology by supposing that these infinite worlds are gods. But, as these worlds are born, it follows that the gods are born as well. Anaximander went further and said the gods sometimes appear and disappear at long intervals. Cicero, admittedly, did not like this theory about the gods and spurned it with ridicule.

	Anaximander was an able investigator in the field of biology. In fact, the first outlines of the theory of evolution are found in testimonia about his doctrines. The way in which animals are generated, he says, is through the evaporation caused by the sun. At first, the species of homo sapiens was more akin to marine animals than humanoids. This ancient supposition squares nicely with the modern discovery of tetrapodomorpha in the Carboniferous Period.

	According to Anaximander, winds arise when the finest vapors become separated and, after they are gathered together, get moved. He said that it rains from this vapor when the sun affects it. As regards the phenomenon of lightning and thunderbolts, it manifests when the wind shakes the clouds and rends them. Thus he explains many meteorological phenomena by winds.</p>
