       <h3>LIFE OF PHEREKYDES/h3>	
    <p>There is some difference respecting the date of Pherekydes’ (Φερεκύδης) birth. The Suda states he was born in Syros during the 45th Olympiad (600-596 BCE), but the more plausible date is somewhere around the 49th Olympiad (584-580 BCE), supposing that the date given to us by Diogenes Laërtius (i.e., the 59th Olympiad, or 544-540 BCE) refers to his floruit, which would make Pherekydes 40 years old at the time. According to Pseudo-Lucian, Pherekydes lived to about 85 years, which means he died around 515-495 BCE. As Thales was the first in the Ionian line of philosophers, so Pherekydes was the first in the Italian one. Many later writers, such as Philo of Byblos and Flavius Josephus, state that Pherekydes, like Thales, did not receive instruction in philosophy from any Greek master, but got his knowledge from either the secret books of the Phoenicians or Egyptian and Chaldean masters. But Alexander of Miletus gives a different account and states that Pherekydes studied with Pittacus. Philo claims that he shares the same theoretical starting-point with the Phoenicians, namely the consideration of the god Ophion. Pythagoras is said to have studied with Pherekydes. There are four incredible stories about the wondrous abilities of Pherekydes. The first is that upon seeing a ship sailing with a fair wind, he said the ship will sink soon, and it sank as soon as he finished his statement. The second story is about how after he had drunk water from a well, he said that there will be an earthquake in two days, and soon enough it came. Another story is that when he suspected a siege of the city of Messene was imminent, he urged his friend, Perilaus, who was living there, to leave the city. Perilaus was not persuaded, and so he remained in the city until it was finally captured. The fourth and final story comes from the Marvels of Theopompus, who relates that Heracles appeared in a dream to both Pherekydes and the Spartan kings, telling them not to hold gold or silver in high honor. Some prefer to attach this last story to Pythagoras instead of Pherekydes, however. The original source of these anecdotes is probably Andron. Pherekydes, along with Terpander and Thales, was highly revered in Sparta. This was because the Spartans thought the ideas of all three sages matched very well with the thought of Lycurgus. But this level of respect was apparently not enough to save him from his allegedly fatal fate; Plutarch says that the Spartans killed Pherekydes and stripped his skin when an oracle requested this to be done. Other tales of his death are admittedly more mild and less cruel. Hermippus relates, besides the Spartan one, three other anecdotes about the death of Pherekydes. The first goes like this: when the Ephesians and Magnesians were at loggerheads with each other, Pherekydes wished for an Ephesian victory, and so when a traveller passed by him, he asked him where he was from and the traveller answered he was from Ephesus. Pherekydes asked the Ephesians to drag him by the legs and to put him down in the land of the Magnesians so he could be buried there. The Ephesians won the next day and honorably fulfilled their promise to Pherekydes. The next account tells us he threw himself off of Mount Corycius. The last story is about how Pythagoras travelled to Delos to help his master upon hearing the news about Pherekydes' sickness.. He asked his teacher how he was feeling and Pherekydes answered him by sticking his finger in the hole of a door and saying “It is clear from my skin”. Pherekydes eventually died from phthiriasis. Pythagoras eventually returned to Italy after he had given the traditional burial rites for his teacher.</p>

    <h3>REVIEW</h3>	<p>Pherekydes was arguably the first person to have written a treatise on philosophy, unless the title of "philosopher" in the vein of systematic authors such as Aristoteles is denied to him. It is a point of contention whether Pherekydes or Cadmus of Miletus was the first author to write in prose. Both of their works possessed a poetical character, according to the Strabo. Although it is likely that Pherekydes’ books were completely extant in the 2nd century AD around the time of Tertullian and Diogenes Laërtius, none of them are extant today. There are, however, several verbatim quotations preserved in the works of later authors and unearthed papyri. The most important source for our knowledge of Pherekydes' thought is the Grenfell Papyrus in which the marriage of Zeus and Chthonie is related. The list of books Pherekydes was purported to have composed is as follows: (1) Heptamythos (The Seven Nooks); (2) The Mixture of the Gods; (3) Theogony. As the titles seem to suggest, these books mostly deal with theogonical topics, or to put it more plainly -- the story of how the olympian gods came to be. The first two entities in Pherekydes’ system are Zas (i.e. Zeus) and Chronos. There was also Chthonie, but she became the “Earth” only after Zeus gifted the planet earth to her. Both Zeus and Chronos were involved in the process of creation. The latter created the so-called “Five-Nook” generation of gods when fire, breath and water came out of Chronos’ seed and were distributed into five recesses, hence the name “Five-Nooks”. Pherekydes, according to the testimony of Proclus, wrote that Zeus had transformed into Eros before he began to create and explains that he did so because he was putting contraries together and for that he needed the harmonic bond of love. Hermias identifies Zeus as the aether and agent, Chthonie as the earth and patient, and Chronos as that in which generated things exist. Zeus is further identified with the sun. Interestingly, Pherekydes shared the idea with Thales that water is the principle of all things, but he called it “Chaos” instead. Pherekydes likely took this notion from Hesiod and called it “water” because it is said to pour out (kheisthai). Sextus Empiricus gives a contrary account and says that he took earth to be the chief principle. According to Porphyry, all this talk of nooks and gates serves as an allegorical representation for the workings of the soul.</p>	
    <p>The chief story in the fragments of Pherekydes is the marriage between Zas and Chthonie. This myth has luckily been preserved in the Grenfell Papyrus. The legend goes like this: Zas had many great and prodigious buildings set up for him by the other gods, and when all the workers and servants had finished their business, they began preparing for the wedding of Zas and Chthonie. On the third day of the wedding, Zas made a beautiful robe embellished with pictures of the Earth, Ogenos (i.e. Oceanus) and the various houses of Ogenos. Zas gave this robe to Chthonie and after telling her the marriage is hers, he asked to marry her. Pherekydes supposed that this is the origin of a nuptial custom named “anakalypteria”, where a groom unveils the bride and gives her gifts. The embellished robe is then placed on a winged oak.</p>	
    <p>Another fascinating myth which was thought to have originated with Pherekydes is the battle between Chronos and Ophioneus. Origen, in his well-known work Contra Celsum, tells us that Chronos and Ophioneus were each given an army in order to fight against one another. They were told that whoever fell into Ogenos would be defeated and whoever expelled his opponent would gain the Heavens. The ending of this story is not clearly indicated, but we can infer from the testimony of Tertullian that Chronos won, since he says that Chronos was “crowned before everyone else”. Origen goes on to list the three guardians of Tartarus – Boreas, Harpies and Thyella.</p> 	
    <p>One peculiar thing about Pherekydes is his use of non-standard names for the Greek gods. For instance, he calls Rhea “Rê” and for "Zeus" he employs a variety of names, such as “Dis”, “Zen”, “Den”, “Zas” and “Zes”. Proclus, curiously enough, refers to the concept of an “outflow” (hekroên) described in his writings. Numenius of Apamea understood this “outflow” to be “the seed” and he identified it with other entities in mythology, such as the river Ameles in Plato and the Styx in Hesiod and Orpheus. Pherekydes claimed that the gods call the banquet table a “table for offerings”. He also supported the notion that the olympian gods were nourished by ambrosia. Apollonius Dyscolus reports that Pherekydes and Democritus employed peculiar forms of the pronoun “my” (e.g. emeu, emeo), and that they also used uncontracted forms of nominative plural pronouns like “hemeis”, “humeis” and “spheis” (we, you, they).</p> 	
    <p>Various ancient authors seemed to have considered Pherekydes as the originator of the doctrine about metempsychosis and the immortality of the soul, the most notable being Cicero in his Tusculanae Disputationes. Pherekydes took the soul to be the life of the body and believed that it was breathed into us from heaven and that it is sustained by earthly seeds.</p> 	
    <p>Certain Christian authors, such as Origen and St. Clement of Alexandria, were keen to remind their pagan rivals that the Pentateuch is far older than both Pherekydes and Homer. Origen says that the story about the Evil One falling from the heavens is already present in the Pentateuch. The Pentateuchical story of the Edenic Fall is contrasted with the tale of the defeat of Ophioneus, whose name, as Origen points out, is derived from the Greek word for snake – Ophis. St. Clement of Alexandria connects the Myth of the Oak
 and the Robe with the prophecy of Cham found in Genesis 9:20-27.</p> 	
    <p>The extant correspondence between Thales and Pherekydes found in the Vitae Philosophorum of Diogenes Laërtius is most likely a forgery. The first letter, sent from Thales to Pherekydes, is about Thales has learnt that Pherekydes is writing a new book and how Thales and Solon plan on travelling to Syros and talking to Pherekydes soon. In the second letter, sent as a reply to Thales, Pherekydes comes off as very morbid and writes to Thales saying that he is afflicted with lice, ague and sickness. Pherekydes then goes on to say that he is undecided on whether to publish his book and so he leaves it to Thales to decide whether to publish it or not. Pherekydes expresses dissatisfaction at the end of the letter when he says that much is left to allegory in his book and and as a result suffers from a want of precision.</p>
    <p>Proclus says in his Commentary on Plato’s Timaeus that Pherekydes’ version of the tale of Atlantis is more enigmatic than Plato’s.</p> 	
    <p>Pherekydes, along with Hippias, said that the Hyades are seven in number.</p>
